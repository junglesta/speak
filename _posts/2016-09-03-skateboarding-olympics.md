Skateboarding should not be in the Olympics because there’s no way to judge or put points on the way someone skates.

**When you compete in the Olympics you can’t roll by your own rules, which is the nature of our culture.**

Also, people from the Olympic Committee who are responsible for this shit only see skateboarding as something that they can profit on. They don’t care about our values, our culture. They don’t represent us in any way. I bet most of them have never stepped on a board. They just want skateboarding to bring young audience to the Olympics so they can profit on that.
