What is the best advice for an ambitious kid born into a poor family with no resources information or support?

Watch the following movies:   
1) Fight Club  
2) Forrest Gump   
3) The Shawshank Redemption   
4) Crouching Tiger Hidden    
5) Enter the Dragon

Afterwards, stop asking for advice (Fight Club). You're missing out on what's out there by following these pointers (Enter the Dragon), because advice interrupts your flow by making you wait and think (Crouching Tiger). The only way to get somewhere is to keep moving (Forrest Gump). It doesn't matter what you're moving towards, direction is meaningless without a cause (Shawshank).
