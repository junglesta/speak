Clutter is taking a toll on both morale and productivity.  
Teresa Amabile of Harvard Business School  
studied the daily routines of more than 230 people  
who work on projects that require creativity.  
As might have been expected,  
she found that  
their ability to think creatively fell markedly  
if their working days were punctuated with meetings.  
They did far better if left to focus on their projects  
without interruption for a large chunk of the day,  
and had to collaborate with no more than one colleague.
