_You told me the internet is broken, that it was always broken. What do you mean by that and do we have extreme capitalism to blame for it?_


Well, the thing is the internet is really stupid. It works really simply in a simple manner and it doesn’t take any adjustments for censorship. Like, if one cable is gone, you take the traffic through some other place. But thanks to the centralization of the internet, (possible) censorship or surveillance tech is a whole lot harder to get around. Also, because the internet was an American invention, they also still have control of it and ICANN can actually force any country top level domain to be censored or disconnected. For me that’s, a really broken design...
