PRE-LOVED ITEMS
By Buy and Flaunt  
(Eastwood City, Libis Quezon City, Philippines)

###Pre-loved ('priːˌlʌvd) -adjective: meaning previously owned.

Fashion always evolves and we believe that the bags that we used to "LOVE" becomes something ordinary for the previous owners. Selling them doesn't mean it looks old or it's out-of-style. It means that owners sell them so that other women can enjoy it :)
