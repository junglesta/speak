This switch from web design to experience design is directly caused by the shift from web pages to digital products, tools, and ecosystems.  

**Web pages are just part of something much bigger: mobile apps, API’s, social media presence, search engine optimization, customer service channels, and physical locations** all (in)form the experience a user has with a brand, product, or service.  

Pretending that you can run a business or deliver value just by taking care of the web channel is naïve at best and harmful at worst.
