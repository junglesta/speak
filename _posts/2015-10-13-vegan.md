Are animals killed in the process of farming vegetarian foods?

Massive. Massive numbers. I grew up in a farming community. In the spring "plow", no snake moves fast enough to escape the plow.  Most infant rodents and hatchlings are helpless as well. As a kid, I had to "brush mow" the field next to my parents' house and I remember being okay with every critter perishing but bunnies. I'm a sucker for bunnies. Every year, I'd freak out and try to save 'em. No luck. They were minced into bunny bits and recycled into the ground. This says NOTHING about insects at all.
