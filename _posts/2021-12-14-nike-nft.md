Nike has acquired RTFKT for an undisclosed amount. NFT studio RTFKT was valued at $33.3 million in May2021 after a seed funding round. The company is behind CloneX, one of the most talked-about NFT project drops of the month. CloneX has seen nearly $65 million in transaction volume since its initial drop, around late November2021, less than three weeks ago. RTFKT also collaborates with crypto creators to design physical items that utilise imagery from NFT projects.
