## Zazzle Drawback 1

_Competition...and Lots of It_

Getting noticed in the endless sea of products is challenging

Most people combat this with by:

- Creating great design
- Appealing to a niche
- Using highly relevant tags to describe their work and
- Self promotion.

- laptop sleeves.
WAY TOO MUCH:
key chains
necklaces

## Zazzle Drawback 3  

_Zazzle Can Change the Terms...:_  

Lots uploaded millions of images and had shops that they made a living off of.  Then the company no longer allowed them to set their royalty rate past 10% if the item was found via their marketplace.

_It Can Take Months or Never For a Design to Sell:_

No sales! Oh no! What is wrong? Have I failed at life and art?  No, U have not failed.  That is very typical.

U upload ...U are starting at the bottom of the pack.

The popularity of Ur panda will rise if you share...and Zazzle records it.

_You Have to Wait...Again...For Your Payment_

2 months wait your payment cos Zazzle has a 30 day return window.

U pay a fee before you meet a certain threshold of payment.
