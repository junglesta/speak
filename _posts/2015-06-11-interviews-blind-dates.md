I've always considered interviews to be a little like a blind date -  there is just so much serendipity to the whole process - from how you walk, to what you're wearing, who you're meeting and and even what you  ate that morning; There are thousands of variables.  

The very same person you marry from your first blind date might just as well have turned you down flat the day before.
