Cognitive dissonance.  

Attitude: I'm on a diet and will avoid fat food   
Behavior: Eating some high fat food    

Change behavior/cognition    
	(Ex: Stop eating the doughnut)    
Justify behavior/cognition by changing the conflicting cognition    
	(Ex: "I can cheat sometimes")    
Justify behavior/cognition by adding new cognitions    
	(Ex: "I'll spend 30 extra minutes at the gym to work it off")  
Ignore/Deny any information that conflicts with existing beliefs     
	(Ex: "I did not eat any fat. I'm always healthy.")
