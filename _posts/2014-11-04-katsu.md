A monk asked:  
"What is the basic meaning of Buddhism?"  

The Master gave a shout. The monk bowed low. The Master said:  
"This fine monk is the kind who's worth talking to!"

The Master said to a monk:
"At times my shout is like the precious sword of the Diamond King. At times my shout is like a golden-haired lion crouching on the ground. At times my shout is like the search pole and the shadow grass. At times my shout doesn't work like a shout at all. Do you understand?"  

The monk started to answer, whereupon the Master gave a shout.
