International tax and duty: International shipments are subject to import fees, duties and taxes, **which are levied once a shipment reaches their country**, in addition to the brokerage fees/custom clearance charges which may be imposed by the carrier. These **charges must be borne by the recipient**. CamRanger has no control over these charges and cannot predict what they might be. If an international shipment is refused and/or returned, any taxes, duties, custom fees, brokerage fees or shipping charges incurred from this return, will be the responsibility of the customer.
