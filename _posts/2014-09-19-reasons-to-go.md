Ask where I come from?

I dont really know what you want to know, wanna kwow last place i've been?

Went to Oz but they wont let me ride a bicycle with no helmet. Too dangerous... kangaroo crossing.

Went to HK and old mens are wearing flip flop in the winter cold.

Went to Singa and lah 1000 dollar fine for picking a flower.

Went to Thailand and always paid. Seen man with tits biggers than the girls ones. Seen kid praying to a billboard image.

Went to Indonesia and liked it. They say Welkom and they dont welcome you. They say Polusi Frustrasi Demokrasi... They pay teachers to get kids promoted. Funny traditions and practical frugality.

Went to England but kids were drunk.

Went to Denmark but really too dark.

Went to France and loved the women.

Went to Italy and I almost couldn't get out anymore.

When to Prague for a short timed invitation. Kids where peeling stickers off our old beaten car.

Went to U.s.a. and all brain washing.

Went to Mexico and saw yankees got squeezed on arrival.

Went to Costa Rica. Ordered Gallo Pinto and came in about a week. Found nice jungle music and way too many guns and powders.

Went to Germany and made some money.

Went to Sri Lanka and never wanted to leave.

Went to Spain and car got robbed.

Yes I still have reasons to go.
