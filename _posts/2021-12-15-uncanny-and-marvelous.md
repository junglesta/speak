TODOROV's literary theory was his definition, in Introduction à la LITTÉRATURE FANTASTIQUE (1970), the fantastic uncanny, and the fantastic MARVELOUS. TODOROV defines the fantastic as being any event that happens in our world that seems to be supernatural. Upon the occurrence of the event, we must decide if the event was an illusion or whether it is real and has actually taken place.
