Flat user interfaces can be seen as a continuation to the idea of skeuomorphism introduced by the early versions of iOS.
The idea was that we can bring people to the mobile by mimicking the real world. Now that people have gotten used to mobile, something new can be tried instead.
That's what flat user interfaces are about.
