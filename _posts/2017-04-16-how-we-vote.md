Political scientists have established that how people vote is determined less by their perceptions about their own lives than by their conceptions of society.

Weâ€™re not particularly interested in what government can do for us personally, we want to know what it can do for us all.

When we cast our vote, we do so not just for ourselves, but for the group we want to belong to.
