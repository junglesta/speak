Many a young person tells me he wants to be a writer.  
I always encourage such people,  
but I also explain that  
there’s a big difference  
between “being a writer” and writing.  
In most cases these individuals are dreaming  
of wealth and fame,  
not the long hours alone writing.  
“You’ve got to want to write”,  
I say to them,  
“not want to be a writer”.
