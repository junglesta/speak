An old lady picked out 3 tomatoes at a stall. The hawker weighed them and asked for 4 dollars.

“Actually I just want to make soup and no need for that many.” The old lady took the biggest tomato off the scale.

“3.5 dollars.” The hawker took another look at the scale.

Before other customers nearby had a chance to warn the old lady about the scale being fishy, she dropped 50 cents on the table and left with the largest tomato.

“姜还是老的辣！” In Chinese we say. It literally translates to “Ginger gets spicier with age!”
